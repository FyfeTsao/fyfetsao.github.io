<h3 id="Commentary"><a href="#Commentary" class="headerlink" title="Commentary"></a>Commentary</h3><p>The traditional Chinese character “暦” here on the index sticker is an obvious misuse. “History” in simplified Chinese is “历史”, but for some reason I would discuss later, the handwriting on the sticker uses traditional versions. Trouble arises when trying to revert simplified characters to traditional because the mapping between them is not always one-to-one (it’s considered an important philosophy in simplification effort). In this case, simplified “历” corresponds to two different traditional characters “曆” and “歷” respectively, between which the staffs unfortunately chose the wrong one. With a component meaning “sun(日)” in “曆”, it means “calendar”. While for “歷” the component is “past(止)”, lending the meaning of “history” to this character. Another interesting fact is about glyph standard. The handwritten version “暦” here meets the Japanese glyph standard, not Chinese one(“曆”, contain more strokes). In China, “暦” is regarded as a variant-form(異體字) which is seldom used, and the standard form is always “曆”, and together with “歷” they were further simplified to “历” during PRC; in Japan, “曆” is standardized to simpler “暦” (usually kunyomi as “こよみ”), and so was “歷” to “歴” (usually onyomi as “れき”). So Japanese people won’t confuse the two characters representing calendar and history. Finally I would like to discuss about the sociocultural context here. Bookstore is disappearing rapidly in China due to the boom of e-commerce, and shallow books have flooded the online shop, so the traditional script here could be understood as struggle toward the severe environment a serious bookstore may face by resorting to something that reflects traditional value. And this store does focusing on selling nice books, unlike other surviving bookshops focusing on selling experience and fantasy about reading, mainly through exquisite interior design.</p>

<h3 id="Commentary"><a href="#Commentary" class="headerlink" title="Commentary"></a>Commentary</h3><p>In China proper, Arabic alphabet is not common on shop signs. The most likely occasion you will see one might be at a muslim restaurant, their shop signs usually contains a “Halal logo”, of which the arabic text “حلال” makes up the most conspicuous visual element. But since there are Hui people and Uyghur people both being muslim within China, their restaurants also show subtle differences. Uyghur restaurants usually have far more Arabic text than Hui restaurants, this is because Uyghur language uses a slightly modified Arabic alphabet, which resembles the Arabic language very much, while Hui people simply use Chinese language as well as its writing system. So it is necessary to add Uyghur Arabic alphabet to their shop signs, not only for decoration or exoticism, but also for pragmatic purpose to appeal Uyghur people living in China proper. On the contrary, shop signs of Hui restaurants tend to emphasize Chinese element, e.g. the use of font which conveys traditional feeling. However the shop sign here is something different, it’s not Uyghur text because it contains a non-Uyghur letter “و (waw)”, except this “waw”, other letters just have same pronunciation like Arabic “sha…rma”. “Shawarma” is a dish just like sandwitch in Middle East cuisine. And the Chinese translation here chose a tricky “想我么(XiangWoMe)”, instead of the more normal and agreed “沙威玛(ShaWeiMa)”, both translations are phonetic adaption, but the former could be understood as Chinese expression “do you miss me” while the latter has no meaning and clearly emanates its foreignness. I suppose that the owner deliberately create the tricky version because as a brand name it may facilitate Chinese-speaking consumers’ brand memory, that’s far more important and realistic than popularizing a largely unknow West Asia dish called “Shawarma” in this distant East Asia country, especially when its culture influence being not that strong here.</p>

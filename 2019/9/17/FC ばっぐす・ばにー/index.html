<h3 id="Commentary"><a href="#Commentary" class="headerlink" title="Commentary"></a>Commentary</h3><p>When I tried to decode the Japanese text here, I just failed and have to re-read it for a second and even third time to grasp its meaning. Unlike other “fake Japanese” appearing on many package design by Chinese small retailers who don’t care much about the correctness of the text but just utilize it as a clue for origin, Zara is a top fast fashion retailer operating globally (as this t-shirt was made in Portugal), it shall scrutinize all the element on its product to avoid incorrectness which might do harm to its brand. The Japanese here is an evidence, it’s correct, but still puzzling for Japanese speakers. When I first read it, I automatically decoded “Baggusu(ばっぐす)” as “Bakkuzu(ばっくず)”, because “gusu” is simply not like a word with Japanese origin, while “kuzu” does. So the question becomes that, why did I presuppose it as a Japanese native word instead of some borrowing with Sino or West origin? I think the key lies in font. Of course written in Hiragana also had its contribution, but appearing in a rather traditional typeface “Kanteiryu(勘亭流)” which suggests a strong feeling of medieval Japan, played the trick here. However when you start to realize that something is wrong if you process it as Japanese native things and switch to another decoding approach, you will soon find out that it is the Japanese transliteration of “Bugs Bunny”, which is the name of the cartoon character on this T-shirt. It is just at this point that I realized that my fail to decipher the text also ascribe largely to my ignorance of this cartoon character’s original English name. In China, its name is translated as “TuBaGe(兔八哥)”, with “Bage(八哥)” serving as the phonetic adaption of “Bugs”, this is exactly the point where I failed to comprehend. Since it was aired in China in 1990s when I was very young, I don’t have much memory of this cartoon, let its name’s origin. For the reason why choosing Hiragana script plus Kanteiryu font here, my insight is that it just strategically does so to construct a Japanese context, together with other elements like the famous Ukiyo-e image in the background and the sword the bunny is holding. All these endeavors aim at adapting the American cartoon character to the Japanese fashion, whose culture has gained increasing influence in the world.</p>
<p>DRAFT<br>a delibrately violation against anticipation created by the characters makes fun and enjoyment.</p>

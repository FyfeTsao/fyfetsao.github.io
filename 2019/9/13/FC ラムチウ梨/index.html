<div lang="zh-CN">蓝田秋月梨</div>

<h4 id="Commentary"><a href="#Commentary" class="headerlink" title="Commentary"></a>Commentary</h4><p>The Japanese text here is weird. With the product’s Chinese name “Lan Tian Qiu Yue Li (蓝田秋月梨)” on the right serving as an important clue, “Ra Mu Chi U (ラムチウ)” seems to be an abbreviation for “Lan Tian Qiu Yue”, i.e. “Ramu Chiu (蓝秋)”, this could be the only understandable approach to the text, though with several flaws. Firstly, for “蓝(ラム)” here, when Onyomi single Chinese character, “mu(ム)” is never used at the end of a character, this is even in conformity with Mandarin phonetics today, we have “-n”(Japanese uses “-ン”), “-ng”(Japanese uses a long vowel), but no “-m”. However “-m” is retained in Cantonese, in Hong Kong there is a railway station whose name is exactly “蓝田” romanized as “Lam Tin”. And “Lam” is a common transliteration of the Cantonese pronunciation of the Chinese surname written with the character “林” among Cantonese people in the world. In Japan, the Onyomi for “藍” is “ラン”, when “ラム” is seen, it must be dealing with something from West for it better suits the phonology of Western languages. Secondly, for “秋(チウ)” here, it isn’t in line with modern Japanese orthography neither, though “チュウ” would look better and make it a correct one, but unfortunately Japanese already has Onyomi for “秋” as “シュウ(Shyu)”. Thirdly, the abbreviation here is questionable. Actually, “秋月梨” is a pear cultivar of Japanese origin, with its name “秋月” being pronounced as “Akizuki (あきづき)”, yes, in a fully Kunyomi style rather than Onyomi. While for “蓝田”, I’m quite confused with its meaning here, in China, “蓝田” is a place name near Xi’an city, and is usually known by “藍田日暖玉生煙” in a famous Tang poem, but since this Japanese pear was introduced into China not long ago, the cultivation area of it was limited to Shandong province (especially Laiyang city), so it couldn’t be claiming the cultivation place. Anyhow the abbreviation from “蓝田(Lantian)” and “秋月(Akizuki)” to “蓝秋(ランシュウ in correct version)” is highly doubtful. My insight about the weird Japanese text here is that they are employed to connote the pear’s Japanese origin, but by staffs with very limited Japanese literacy. The ideal text for this case should be “あきづき梨”. It’s a usual strategy to do so in China, because sellers benefit from it by charging higher prices. For instance, a pear of this cultivar costs about 10 yuan, and a gift package in cardbox of them (as in this photo) costs about 100 yuan. That’s so dear compared with its peers and makes you feel as if you were buying fruit in Japan (except the “Fake Japanese” characters).</p>
